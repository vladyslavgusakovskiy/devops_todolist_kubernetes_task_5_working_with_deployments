Deploying the App to Kubernetes
1. Create a deployment.yml file with the necessary configurations.
2. Create an hpa.yml file for the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
3. Apply the Deployment Manifest - kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
4. Deploy the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) - kubectl apply -f hpa.yml

Choice of Resource Requests and Limits
These are standard values for a lightweight web app. The minimum CPU (50m) and memory (64Mi) ensure basic performance. The limits (200m CPU, 128Mi memory) prevent excessive resource usage.

Choice of HPA Configuration
Minimum replicas set to 2 to ensure high availability. Maximum replicas set to 5 to handle peak traffic. Autoscaling triggers when CPU or memory utilization exceeds 70%. This setup ensures the app scales efficiently based on workload.

Choice of Deployment Strategy
RollingUpdate strategy ensures zero downtime during deployments. maxUnavailable: 1 → At most, one pod can be unavailable during updates. maxSurge: 1 → At most, one extra pod can be created temporarily during updates. This approach keeps the app available 24/7 while using minimal resources.

How to Access the App After Deployment
You can access the app using: http://localhost:30007
